    My name a Borat. I come from Kazakhstan. Can I say a first, we support your war of terror! May we show our support to our boys in Iraq! May US and A kill every single terrorist! May your George Bush drink the blood of every single man, women, and child of Iraq! May you destroy their country so that for next thousand years not even a single lizard will survive in their desert!

    I arrived in America's airport with clothings, US dollars, and a jar of gypsy tears to protect me from AIDS.

    I, uh, like a very much Korki Buchek. You know Korki Buchek? Bing-bang-bing-bang-bing-dl-dl-ding-ding *click* *click* *click-click* bing-bang-bing-bang-bing-dl-dl-ding-ding *click* *click*
