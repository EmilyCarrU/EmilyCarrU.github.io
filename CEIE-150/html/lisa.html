    <p> Sometime my sister, she show her <em>vazh√Øn</em> to my brother Bilo and say <strong>"You will never get this, you will never get it, la la la la la la!"</strong> He behind his cage. He cries, he cries and everybody laughs. She goes "You never get this." But one time he break cage and he "get this" and then we all laugh. High five! </p>

<p> It is three in the morning, and I am in the nest of Jews. They have cleverly shifted their shapes; one of them has taken the form of a little old woman. You can barely see her horns! She has tried to poison me already. These rats are very clever.</p>

    <p> My name a Borat. I come from <b>Kazakhstan</b>. Can I say a first, we support your war of terror! May we show our support to our boys in Iraq! May US and A kill every single terrorist! May your George Bush drink the blood of every single man, women, and child of Iraq! May you destroy their country so that for next thousand years not even a single lizard will survive in their desert!</p>
