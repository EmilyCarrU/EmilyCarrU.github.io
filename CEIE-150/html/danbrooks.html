In Kazakhstan, it is illegal for more than five woman to be in the same place except for in brothel or in grave. In U.S. and A., many womens meet in a groups called feminists.

Sometime my sister, she show her vazhïn to my brother Bilo and say "You will never get this, you will never get it, la la la la la la!" He behind his cage. He cries, he cries and everybody laughs. She goes "You never get this." But one time he break cage and he "get this" and then we all laugh. High five!

Yagshemash! In U.S. and A., if you want to marry a girl, you cannot just go to her father's house and swap her for 15 gallons of insecticide. Before American woman will allow you in her vazhïn, you must do something called dating.
