    Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.

    I'm Batman

    It was a dog. It was a big dog.

    Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud.

    It will be extremely painful... for you

    Gordon... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.

    I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.

    Very well. Death! By exile.

    But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.

    This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

    Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

    If you're good at something, never do it for free.

    Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

    Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.
