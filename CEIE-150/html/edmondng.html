    <p>Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of <strong>the</strong> wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.</p>

    <p>I'm <strong>Batman</strong></p>

    <p>It was a dog. It <strong>was</strong> a big dog.</p>

    <p>Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look <strong>very fashionable</strong>. Apart from the mud.</p>

    <p>It will be extremely painful... <strong>for</strong> you</p>

    <p><strong>Gordon</strong>... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.</p>

    <p>I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions <strong>in broad daylight</strong>. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.</p>

    <p>Very well. Death! By exile.</p>

    <p>But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.</p>

    <p>This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.</p>

    <p><i>Bruce Wayne</i>, eccentric billionaire.</p>

    <p>If you're good at something, never do it for free.</p>

    <p>Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.</p>

    <p>Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.</p>
