    <p>Yagshemash! In U.S. and A., if you want to <strong>marry a girl</strong>, you cannot just go to her father's house and swap her for 15 gallons of insecticide. Before American woman will allow you in her vazh√Øn, you must do something called dating.</p>

    <p>In <em>Kazakhstan</em>, it is illegal for more than five woman to be in the same place except for in brothel or in grave. In U.S. and A., many womens meet in a groups called feminists.</p>

    <p>I had no car, no money, and no Azamat. The only thing keeping me going was my dream of one day holding Pamela in my arms and then making romantic explosion on her stomach.</p>
