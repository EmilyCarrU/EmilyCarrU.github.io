    <p>I'm writing a body of text in HTML and it's going to show up like a paragraph and that's <b>cuhrazy!</b>
      <strong>STRONG</strong> is the a/v tag version of <b>Bold.</b></p>
   
    <p>I'm surprised at how much I remember about <i>HTML</i> from blogging all my <s>emo</s> teenage angst.
      <em>EM or EMPHASIS</em> is the a/v tag version of <i>Italics.</i></p>
    <br>
    <br>What happens if I use the BR tags instead of creating P tags, might be messy but I'm curious and also rambling and also need coffee.
