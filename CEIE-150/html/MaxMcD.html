   <P>What's up with it, vanilla face? Me and my homie Azamat just parked our slab outside. We're looking for somewhere to post up our black asses for the night. So, uh, bang bang, skeet skeet, nigga. Just a couple of pimps, no hoes.</P>

    <P>Yagshemash. In U.S. and A., very rich people like to drink wine. It is like Kazakhi wine, but not made from fermented horses' urine.</P>

    <P>My name a Borat. I come from Kazakhstan. Can I say a first, we support your war of terror! May we show our support to our boys in Iraq! May US and A kill every single terrorist! May your George Bush drink the blood of every single man, women, and child of Iraq! May you destroy their country so that for next thousand years not even a single lizard will survive in their desert!</P>
