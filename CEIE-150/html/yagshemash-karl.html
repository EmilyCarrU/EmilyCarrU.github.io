  <p>Yagshemash! In U.S. and A., if you want to marry a girl, you cannot just go to her father's house and swap her for 15 gallons of insecticide. Before American woman will allow you in her vazh√Øn, you must do something called dating.</p>

  <p>In Kazakhstan, it is illegal for more than five woman to be in the same place except for in brothel or in grave. In U.S. and A., many womens meet in a groups called feminists.</p>
